# ft_irc

This project involves creating your own IRC server in C++ 98. Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based communication protocol on the Internet, offering real-time messaging that can be either public or private. Users can exchange direct messages and join group channels. IRC clients connect to IRC servers, and servers are connected together to form a network.
